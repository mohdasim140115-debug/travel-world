/* =========================================================
   PACKAGE DEFAULTS
   Several sections of a package page fall back to standard
   content when the admin has not written their own — the
   exclusions list, the cancellation slabs, the payment terms,
   the upgrades, "need to know", "tour details" and the FAQs.

   Those fallbacks used to live inside the page, which meant
   the admin saw an empty box for text the visitor could
   plainly read. They live here now so the page and the edit
   form agree on exactly what the page is serving, and the
   form can prefill the boxes with it.
