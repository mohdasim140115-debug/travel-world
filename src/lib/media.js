/* =========================================================
   UPLOADED MEDIA
   Images uploaded from the admin panel live in MongoDB, not
   in public/. Vercel's filesystem is read-only at runtime, so
   anything written to public/ after the build disappears on
   the next deploy — the upload would appear to work and the
   picture would vanish.

   Each file is resized and re-encoded to WebP before storing,
   which turns a 6 MB phone photo into roughly 200 KB, and is
   addressed by the hash of its bytes, so uploading the same
   picture twice stores it once and the URL can be cached
   forever.
