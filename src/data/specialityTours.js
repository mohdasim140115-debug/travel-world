   SPECIALTY TOURS
   Two categories already have real, fully curated pages
   (Women's Special / Seniors' Special) — those are linked to
   directly. Every other category resolves through
   getSpecialityConfig() below, which matches real packages by
   category/keyword (same "never a dead link" pattern already
   used by src/data/destinations.js's generic resolver) so the
   /speciality-tours/[category] route never 404s or renders an
   empty page.
