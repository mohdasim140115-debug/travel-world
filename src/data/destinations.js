   GENERIC FALLBACK RESOLVER

   The navbar mega menu links to well over a hundred
   destinations. Rather than hand-author a curated entry for
   every single one, only the richest/most-searched
   destinations above are curated. Every other mega-menu
   slug is resolved here: we derive a display name from the
   slug, find real matching packages already in packages.js
   (via keyword aliases for country/region names that don't
   literally appear in package text), and fall back to a
   small flagship package set so a listing page is never
   empty. This guarantees zero dead links.
